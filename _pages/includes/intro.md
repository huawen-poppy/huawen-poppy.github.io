# ðŸ‘‹ About Me  ([CV](https://huawen-poppy.github.io/images/Huawen_Zhong-CV.pdf))
I am currently Ph.D student in BioEngineering of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) supervised by Prof. [Manuel Aranda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yt9D7cgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wqdK8ugAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Previously, I received my master's degree from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), supervised by Prof. Miao He, and my bachelorâ€™s degree in South China Normal University (SCNU). 

My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to biosciences, with an emphasis on large-scale dataset integration and analysis. I work primarily with single-cell transcriptomic data and Nanopore direct RNA-seq long-read data. By leveraging advances in deep learning, my goal is to decipher cellular systems and deepen our understanding of functional genomics to advance healthcare.
